CurrencyConverter is a simple Java programming project I have begun. 

The aim of this project is to get back into personal programming again and familiar with Java.

This will be one of many programming projects.

CurrencyConverter is a program that utilizes an API to convert an X amount of money into another currency.

CurrencyConvter will be able to be interacted with both through console and a GUI.

This project serves to expand my knowledge and experience as well as being a bit of fun. 

But all personal programming projects are fun!
